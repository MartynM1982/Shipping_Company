# Shipping Company
In this project, we will build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using the Shipping company.

The shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you arenâ€™t charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
Here are the prices:

Ground Shipping

Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
2 lb or less	$1.50	$20.00
Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$3.00	$20.00
Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$4.00	$20.00
Over 10 lb	$4.75	$20.00

Ground Shipping Premium

Flat charge: $125.00

Drone Shipping

Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
2 lb or less	$4.50	$0.00
Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$9.00	$0.00
Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$12.00	$0.00
Over 10 lb	$14.25	$0.00

We will write a Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using the shiiping company.
